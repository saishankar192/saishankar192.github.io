		<h3> PUBLICATIONS: </h3>
		<h3> Impact of Driving Behavior on Commuters Comfort during Cab Rides: Towards a New Perspective of Driver Rating </h3>
		<p><b>Authors:​</b> Rohit Verma, ​ Sai Shankar Kambalapalli​ , Ms. Sugandh Pargal, Debasree Das, Tanusree Parbat, Bivas Mitra, Dr. Sandip Chakraborty</p>
		<p> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Submitted to CSCW 2020 June 2020 for publication which is under revision</p>
		<p><b>Description:​</b> ​ Extracted the perceived comfort level of a commuter based on the driving behavior, to provide feedback
to the drivers and help them meet the commuters' satisfaction​ .</p>
		<p><b>Work Done:​</b> ​ Analysed the ElectroCardioGram(ECG) signals and built RR Interval, using which Heart Rate Variability is
determined via time-domain Features such as RMSSD, pNN50, frequency domain features like LF/HF ratio.
Determined the stress level based on HRV data. </p>

		<h3> PROJECTS: </h3>
		<div id="project_one">
			<h3>Application of Graph algorithm for optimization of Kharagpur academic area traffic</h3>
			<p><b>Guide:​</b> Professor Sudeshna Mitra, Civil Engineering Department</p>
			<p>Analyzed the Speed of vehicles on a determined road using the Radar meter method. Collected field data and used them to calculate Mean speed, Standard deviation, and Median. Used the Dijkstra algorithm from graph theory to find the optimal path from source to all given junctions based on speed and density of vehicles.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div id="project_two">
			<h3>Impact of the Driving Environment on the Driving Behavior of Cab Drivers - An Empirical Study</h3>
			<p><b>Guide:</b>​ Professor Sandip Chakraborty, Computer Science, and Engineering Department</p>
			<p>Obtained real-world features such as the location of the vehicles from unstructured video data(from Berkley). Applied the Yolo model for object detection. Used Score thresholding, Non-max suppression filters to remove redundancy thereby improving the accuracy.</p>
